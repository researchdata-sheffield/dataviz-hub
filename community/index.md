The most important part of the initiative is to build a community around dataviz and we hope to achieve this in a number of ways.

### Communication channels

We’re also working on developing a community communication framework. We’ve started with a **TUoS google group** which can be joined [here](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/?hl=en#!forum/shef_dataviz-group) through a TUoS google account. But are working on expanding and diversifying communication channels. But we are working on expanding and diversifying communication channels and have now added a slack channel for more informal communication and chat. Join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/shef-dataviz/signup) and remember to say hello in our **#welcome** channel.

### Events

We’ll be hosting a **variety of events** including **talks & symposia, workshops, vis-coding clubs and data visualisation hackathons!**. 

You'll be able to find out more when we formally launch the initiative at our inaugural **shef dataviz hub forum event**...coming to the Diamond Siemens MindSphere soon, watch this space! But just to give an idea, here's a selection of workshops in the pipeline:

1. Data visualisation in R
1. R, htmlwidgets & Shiny 
1. Dataviz using vegalite

### Contributing

We are constantly looking for new ideas and suggestions for events, workshops or tutorials. Feel free to get in touch with us through the googlegroup or slack channel with any suggestions. We will also be putting together more formal contributing guidance should you wish to contribute to our online resources.
