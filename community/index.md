> The most important part of the initiative is to build community around data visualisation. We hope to achieve this in a number of ways.

### Communication channels

We’re also working on developing a community communication framework. We’ve started with a **TUoS google group** which can be joined [here](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/?hl=en#!forum/shef_dataviz-group) through a TUoS google account. But are working on expanding and diversifying communication channels. But we are working on expanding and diversifying communication channels and have now added a slack channel for more informal communication and chat. Join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/shef-dataviz/signup) and remember to say hello in our **#welcome** channel.

### Events

We’ll be hosting a **variety of events** including **talks & symposia, workshops, vis-coding clubs and data visualisation hackathons!**. 

You'll be able to find out more when we formally launch the initiative at our inaugural **Data Visualisation Hub forum event**...coming to the LT6 in the Arts Tower on the **April 25th 2018, 12-2pm**.
