## Welcome to shef dataviz hub!
### Promoting and build community around data visualisation at TUoS
 
Visualision has always been at the core of extracting understanding from data and analyses, put powerful open source interactive web-based data visualisation tools have revolutionised the potential for research data impact. 

To help are researchers make the most of their data and take advantage of such tools, we (Research Software Engineering, the University Library and CICS) have been working on a multipronged initiative to provide tools, training and build a community around interactive data visualisation at TUoS.

### ORDA data visualisation showcase

In 2017, ORDA (Online Research Data) was launched, a free platform for all University of Sheffield research staff and students to share their datasets, code, presentations, posters, grey literature and other non-traditional research outputs. As part of ORDA, we've developed a [**data visualisation showcase site**](https://orda.shef.ac.uk/visualisations/) where researchers are able to host interactive data visualisations and also link them to reposited data in ORDA. 

<br>

### Community
 
We’ll be hosting a **variety of events** including **talks & symposia, workshops, vis-coding clubs and data visualisation hackathons!** Find out more excited to formally launch the initiative at our datavis hub forum event...coming to the Siemens MindSphere soon, watch this space!

#### OxShef dataviz

We’re collaborating with the [**Interactive Data Network**](https://idn.it.ox.ac.uk/) at the **University of Oxford** as [**OxShef dataviz**](https://oxshef.github.io/oxshef/) and will be co-organising events and co-developing open CC-By resources. More details to follow soon. For now, you can follow the initiative on [twitter](https://twitter.com/oxshef_dataviz)
 
We’re also working on developing a community communication framework. We’ve started with a **TUoS google group** which can be joined [here](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/?hl=en#!forum/shef_dataviz-group) through a TUoS google account. But are working on expanding and diversifying communication channels. 

<br>

### Resources

There many tools for visualisation. We've narrowed it down to some of the most popular technologies that interact well with research workflows, are flexible, and allow introducing interactivity. The majority of our documentation will live on the [**OxShe Charts**](https://oxshef.github.io/oxshef_charts/) site and includes details on chart types and tutorials in **R** and **python**. These will continue to be added to.

### Contribute

From ideas to content for the ORDA showcase, our blog or datavis documentation, contributions are open to all. For the moment just get in touch with us at **??@shef.ac.uk**
