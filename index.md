## Welcome to shef dataviz hub!
### Promoting and build community around data visualisation at TUoS
 
One of the best ways to make sure that data you share is working for you is to create easy ways for other researchers to explore the datasets. We (Research Software Engineering, the University Library and CICS) are therefore developing a data visualisation showcase site (https://orda.shef.ac.uk/visualisations/) as part of ORDA.
 
Community
 
We’ll be hosting a variety of events including talks & symposia, workshops, vis-coding clubs and data visualisation hackathons! Find out more excited to formally launch the initiative at our datavis hub forum event...coming to the Siemens MindSphere soon, watch this space.
We’re also collaborating with the Interactive Data Network at the University of Oxford as OxShef dataviz and will be co-organising events and co-developing resources.
 
We’re working on developing community communication framework. To begin with, we’ve set up a google group which can be joined [here](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/?hl=en#!forum/shef_dataviz-group).
 
Resources
There many tools for visualisation. We've narrowed it down to some of the most popular technologies that interact well with research workflows, are flexible, and allow introducing interactivity.
