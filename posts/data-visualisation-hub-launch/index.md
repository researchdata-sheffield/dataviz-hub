We’re thrilled to invite you to the **first Data Visualisation Hub Forum** event on the **25th April 2018 at LT6 in the Arts Tower**. During the event, we'll be unveiling our hopes and plans for the Hub which ultimately aims to spark cross-disciplinary collaborative relationships, knowledge exchange and capacity building around data visualisation. 

The event is scheduled for **lunchtime (12-2pm)**, will begin with **3-4 talks**, followed by a series of **lightning talks** (full schedule to be confirmed soon). This will be followed by a **Q & A panel in which we'll open the floor to questions and discussion** from the audience. Finally, we’ll close with **lunch and an opportunity to network**.

See full schedule [here](../../launch/hub-launch-schedule/)
